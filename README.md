- 👋 Hi, I’m Rakesh B R

- 👀 I’m interested in Data science using the machine learning algorithms to build the artificial intelligent machine.  

- 🌱 An extroverted Programmer/Analyzer/Visualizer, who tries to be better each day. Adapting to various work cultures, identifying and resolving bottlenecks, and prioritizing have been striking features of my working style.

My technical expertise includes Python, Machine learning, Data structures, Algorithms, SQL, MLOPS(GCP, Azure), Apache Spark, Data Visualization(Tableau, Power BI, Excel), Math's and statistics, AWS, GitHub.

Interested in Data Science, Machine learning and also I have worked on projects(POC) in Data Science And quite interested in coding competition.

Working at Flexera as a software Development engineer, Built Microservices using Go language as a backend language, Deployment of Microservices into AWS Cloud Platform (EKS) using Kubernetes, ETL and
Docker. DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, AWS services (DMS, DynamoDB, EC2, S3), Prometheus, Grafana, Errbit. Worked on Relational, Non-Relational and NoSQL databases like MSSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB. and also worked on localstack (local AWS).


- I have worked on projects in Data Science here is the POC(https://github.com/RakeshBR1999/GRIP-Internship) and quite interest in coding competition(https://leetcode.com/Rakesh1999/).

- 💞️ I’m looking forward to work/contribute as A data scientist to build a model with my Proven knowledge in the various projects and the industries.
