- 👋 Hi, I’m Rakesh B R
- 👀 I’m interested in Data science using the machine learning algorithms to build the artificial intelligent machine.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning algorithms and NLP and currently I am working in Flexera as Software Development Engineer,Building Microservices using the Golang as a backend language, Deployment of Microservices into AWS Cloud Platform (EKS) using Kubernetes and
